## How to install

To be able to run this, I recommend using Python 3.6 or up.

1. Install the requirements 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies for running this. 

2. Download the sample data

The sample data can be downloaded from [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hP-v8lLn1g1jEaJUBYJhv1mEb32hkMvG/view?usp=sharing) More data will be added soon. 

3. Run the program

``` 
python3 parser.py ./<path-to-sample-data-hevc> 
```

## What's next ? 

- Traffic light, Car, Truck, Bicycle, Motorcycle, Pedestrians and Stop sign detection using YOLOv3.
- Real Time semantic segmentation, or almost real time.
- Fast SLAM.
